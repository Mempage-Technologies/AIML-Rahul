This is the repository where I will be uploading all the stuff that I am doing during the training program. I will try to keep it as understandable as possible.

All codes are written in Python 3.7 and executed on tensorflow-gpu 2.1 on a Windows 10 laptop and Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics card. <br><br>
✔️ = Code Uploaded <br>
🔶 = Code Uploading Soon<br>
📷 = Image Classification (Binary or Multiclass)

### 1. Cats vs. Dogs dataset🔶📷
---
Using cats vs dogs dataset provided in the tensorflow datasets, I have written a convolutional neural network to distinguish cats from dogs and classify them. This is a binary class classification. 

### 2. Handwritten Digits Recognition ✔️📷
---
A simple hello world to Deep Neural Networks. A multi-class classification task with 10 classes

### 3. Fashion MNIST Classification ✔️📷
---
A simple clothes classification using Deep Neural Networks. A multi-class classification task with 10 classes.

### 4. Beans Classification🔶📷
---
Classification of beans dataset into three classes using InceptionV3 model and transfer learning. This is a multi-class classification task with 3 classes.
